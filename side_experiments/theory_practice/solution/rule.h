// - best for things that shouldn't be done?

// - perhaps if you see X, then fail?

// - perhaps fail if some combination of actions and obs

// - especially focus on combinations that are bad with low variance

// - so patterns are like:
//   - if you get rid of the obviously bad things...
//   - ...then pattern informs on what's needed to be done

// - uncaught rules otherwise overshadow patterns?
//   - or rules at least help filter out a lot of the useless random tries
//     - so patterns can be revealed

// - or, if something can be filtered out using a simple rule...
//   - ...then don't need to spend all the effort of looking for a pattern for it

// - simply evaluate rules afterwards
//   - instead of finding ways to like avoid triggering the rules
