// - should not think of sequences for world modeling
//   - so just the impact of counts of actions

// - same things with obs?

// - use solution building to expand graph?

// - need state somehow, but probably not from solution building
//   - that state can be connected to sequences
//     - but solution state can be used to initialize world state

// - maybe use world state to predict outcome
//   - but also predict when predictions begin to be inaccurate and branch

// - probably don't worry about state assignment for compound actions

// - maybe world modeling is just saving failures
//   - "what happens if you do so and so when so and so?"
//     - if tried, then can say exactly
//     - otherwise, not sure, and can potentially try

// - should something be done about minor variations?
//   - extra action added or removed here or there?
//     - probably not, because can never know?
//       - but there's also likely some correlation
//   - or like alternating order

// - maybe have a similarity score, and use it to weigh exploration?
//   - Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance

// - maybe when you're thinking, you're just searching for something that has good distance characteristics?

// - perhaps difference between natural selection and learning is that can't capture the impact of failures
