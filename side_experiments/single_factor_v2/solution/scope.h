/**
 * - scopes are just a bit of abstraction to try to promote the reuse of ideas
 *   - scopes roughly capture when certain state is relevant, but is extremely imprecise
 *     - the actual corresponding actions may start sooner or later, and may end sooner or later
 *   - in addition, may need to constantly break up scopes to use elsewhere
 *   - but as long as scopes, inner scopes, etc., are being created and reused, should be good enough to make progress
 * 
 * - specifically, here, the states created are too loose
 *   - i.e., they likely include more actions than is relevant for the state
 *     - so from the outside, there's more that's abstracted, but from the inside, will miss possible sub-scopes
 *       - though sub-scopes will likely be created on branch
 *         - so again, probably good enough
