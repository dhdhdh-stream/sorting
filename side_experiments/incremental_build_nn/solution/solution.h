/**
 * - world modeling cannot be used for innovation
 *   - even small changes can lead to unique outcomes and cannot predict what hasn't been tried
 *     - cannot even predict if something is familiar so no need to try further
 *       - as new changes may lead to better predictions
 * 
 * - world modeling is good for surviving
 *   - which, for humans, is needed to reach the frontiers of knowledge
 *     - so world modeling is a foundation for innovation for humans
 * 
 * - innovation is simply slow and costly
 *   - only way to speed things up is to cheat, i.e, to learn
